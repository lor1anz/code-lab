# code-lab

**code-lab** is a personal laboratory for small learning projects, experiments, and quick prototypes.  
Here I explore new technologies, test ideas, understand concepts, and practice programming skills.

## What’s Inside
- small standalone learning projects  
- experiments with algorithms, data structures, graphics, networking, etc.  
- quick prototypes and idea exploration  
- test scripts and understanding-oriented snippets

## Purpose
To create a space for free experimentation — without strict rules about architecture, structure, or code quality.  
The goal is to learn, explore, and try things out.
